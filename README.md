## Setup
  - Go to this website: https://bugtracker3000.herokuapp.com/
  - First create an account -> sign up button on navbar
  - Then go to landing page and choose whether you want to add a bug or have an overview
  - So you can add bugs via 'report a bug' and give a title, description and assign it to someone
  - On the overview page you already see some bug examples that I have made -> mostly suggestions for the website ;)
  - You may delete them or mark them as done
  - And that's it in a nutshell
  - It was good experience working on this and I already see a lot of room for improvement and I'm sure you will too, but we'll talk about that during the debrief -> thank you for your time Pablo!
